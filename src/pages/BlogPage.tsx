          <p className="text-secondary-500 text-sm mb-4">Author: Admin Jayar</p>
          <p className="text-secondary-700 mb-6">
            Have you ever wondered how solar panels turn sunlight into usable electricity? It’s a fascinating process that harnesses the power of nature 
            and transforms it into energy we can use every day.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-secondary-900 mb-2">The Science Behind Solar Power</h3>
          <p className="text-secondary-700 mb-6">
            Solar panels are made up of photovoltaic (PV) cells. When sunlight hits these cells, it creates an electric field. This direct current (DC) electricity 
            is then converted into alternating current (AC) electricity through an inverter — the type of power your home uses.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-secondary-900 mb-2">What Happens to Extra Energy?</h3>
          <p className="text-secondary-700">
            If your system produces more energy than you need, the surplus can be stored in batteries or fed back into the electrical grid — often earning you credits on your bill through a process called net metering.

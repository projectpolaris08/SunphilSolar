        "Sunphil Solar designed and installed a custom 8kW hybrid solar system on June 21, 2025, featuring an 8kW Deye Hybrid Inverter, 18 x 620W AE Bifacial Solar Panels (11.16kW total capacity), and 2 x 51.2V 314Ah LiFePO4 Batteries (32.2kWh total storage) for maximum energy independence and extended backup power during outages.",
      results:
        "Mr. Padojinog's monthly consumption dropped from 910 kWh to just 16 kWh (98.2% reduction), with his Meralco bill plummeting from â‚±12,274.62 to â‚±225.03 achieving â‚±12,049.59 monthly savings (98.2% cost reduction). The system now provides near-complete energy independence with reliable backup power, even during week-long storms.",
